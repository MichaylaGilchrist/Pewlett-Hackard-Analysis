2. There are a total of 711 employees with a title containing 'Senior' which leaves plenty of employees that can be promoted. 

## Summary
There are a large number of employees that are of retirement age at Pewlett Hackard, a so called 'silver tsunami' is coming up. Of the 331,603 employees currently employeed, there are 72,458 people set to retire determined by age. 

In order to see if there are enough employees set to take over for those retiring, a mentorship eligibilty criteria was checked by using a birth year of 1965. There are a total of 1,549 employees using this standard. By only using a single year as a mentorship eligibility requirement there would not be enough employees to replace those that are retiring. There are more than enough retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation however it would need to expand the mentorship criteria to fill those roles.
